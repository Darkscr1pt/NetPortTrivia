# NetPortTrivia

Description and Purpose:

A Python application that allows you to practice the association of service names (protocols) to network port numbers. Can be used for self-training for work or as a preparation for job interviews in networking, engineering and infrastructures roles. 

To start practicing:

1. Install Python on your machine:

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install python3.9

2. Download the script to your machine:

git clone https://github.com/Darkscr1pt/NetPortTrivia.git

3. Make the script executable:

chmod +x NetPortTrivia.py

4. Run the script: 

python3 NetPortTrivia.py

5. The script will randomly display the names of network protocols/services and will prompt you to enter their corresponding port numbers. A correct answer adds one point to your score and incorrect answers subtract one point from your score.

6. To win, you need to reach 20 points. 

7. Game over if your score hits -3.

8. Have fun and good luck :)
