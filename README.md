# NetPortTrivia
A Python application that allows you to practice the association of service names (protocols) to network port numbers. Can be used to prepare for job interviews in networking, engineering, infrastructures etc. 

To start practicing:

1. Download the script to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/Darkscr1pt/NetPortTrivia.git

2. Make the script executable:
chmod +x NetPortTrivia.py

3. Run the script: 
python3 NetPortTrivia.py

4. The script will randomly display the names of network protocols/services and will prompt you to enter their corresponding port numbers. A correct answer adds one point to your score and incorrect answers substract one point from your score.

5. To win, you need to reach 20 points. 

6. Game over if your score hits -3.

7. Have fun and good luck :)
